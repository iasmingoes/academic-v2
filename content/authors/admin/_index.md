I am a Junior Research Fellow at the [Carlos III -- Juan March Institute](https://ic3jm.es/en) in Madrid, where I study the political economy of natural resources. My research examines how and when resource-rich governments invest in durable public goods, instead of using revenue from oil, gas, or mining for short-term political gain.

I hold a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), in addition to degrees in Political Science and Latin American Studies from [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html). I was born in Brazil and named Iasmin (rather than the more traditional variant Yasmin) because Y was not a letter of the [Portuguese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_orthography) at the time.
